Here's a more friendly and concise version of your `README.md` file for the project "Budgeting App Backend":

# Welcome to the Budgeting App Backend! üöÄ

This is the powerhouse of the Budgeting App. It's a backend application built with FastAPI that handles all your personal budgeting and expense data.

## Getting Started üöÄ

1. Copy the repository: `git clone https://github.com/resivalex/budgeting-app-backend.git`
2. Install what's necessary: `poetry install`
3. Set up your environment variables. (Don't worry, we'll tell you where everything goes.)
4. Set up Google Drive credentials (see [Google Drive Integration](#google-drive-integration-))
5. Start the server: `poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload`
6. Voil√†! You can now access the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Google Drive Integration üîÑ

The Budgeting App uses Google Drive exclusively for backing up transaction dumps. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a Google Cloud Project at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable the Google Drive API for your project
3. Create a Service Account in the Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Give it a name like "budgeting-app-service"
   - Grant it the "Drive API > Drive File Creator" role
4. Create and download the JSON key for this service account
5. Save the JSON key to your `credentials` folder as `google-drive-credentials.json`
6. Create a folder in Google Drive where you want to store your transaction dumps
7. Share this folder with the service account email (it will look like `service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
8. Get the folder ID from the URL when you open the folder (it's the long string in the URL after `/folders/`)
9. Add these variables to your `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=credentials/google-drive-credentials.json
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_google_drive_folder_id
   
   # Optional: Configure the daily backup schedule (24-hour format, UTC timezone)
   DAILY_DUMP_HOUR=3
   DAILY_DUMP_MINUTE=0
   ```

Transaction data will be automatically backed up to Google Drive daily at the configured time (default: 3:00 AM UTC).

## Scheduled Data Backup üïí

The application includes an automatic daily backup system that:

1. Exports all transaction data as CSV
2. Uploads it to your configured Google Drive folder
3. Names the file with a timestamp for easy identification
4. Runs daily at your configured time (default: 3:00 AM UTC)

You can configure the backup time by setting these environment variables:
- `DAILY_DUMP_HOUR`: Hour of the day in 24-hour format (0-23)
- `DAILY_DUMP_MINUTE`: Minute of the hour (0-59)

For manual backups, use the `/trigger-dump` endpoint.

## API Endpoints üåê

The Budgeting App Backend offers you these API endpoints:

- `System`: Check the system health.
- `Configuration`: Retrieve the backend configuration.
- `State`: Get app settings, transactions, and import or export transactions.
- `Admin`: Administrative functions like manually triggering backups.

Each endpoint does something special. Feel free to explore them!

## Code Structure üèóÔ∏è

Here's a sneak peek into our project's blueprint:

- `budgeting_app_backend/` - The brain of our app.
- `main.py` - The entry point of our application and the FastAPI app configuration.
- `requirements.txt` - A list of Python dependencies required by the project.
- `README.md` - Hey, that's this file!

## Development üíª

Want to make the Budgeting App Backend your own? Here's how:

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies.
2. Make your changes to the code.
3. Run the server for testing with live reloading. See your changes in real-time!
4. Test the endpoints using an API client of your choice.
